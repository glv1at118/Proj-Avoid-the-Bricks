# Avoid-the-Bricks

This is an interesting web page game project. You need to help your little friend (it's Tom now!) dodge the bricks.

Created this game with vanilla HTML and CSS, together with Javascript (and jQuery). The design and coding experience is interesting, and rewarding. Will keep updating the game with new gameplay contents.

Things that you can do in the game:
- Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control your block, which is the deep pink one.
- The blocks will come down. Try to dodge them to survive. You only have 1 life.
- You can select the difficulty levels in game (easy, medium, hard, and crazy). However you can only shift levels before a new round starts. Level selector buttons will automatically be disabled when the round is running. Try and see.
- You can change themes of the interface at anytime you like.
- See the scoreboards for historical highest record info, for different difficulty levels.
- More...
